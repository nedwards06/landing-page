# landing-page

This project, a simple landing page, was assigned as part of the
"Foundations" course in TOP (The Odin Project).

The idea is to build a landing page from scratch based on only
2 images: an image of the complete website, and one with some
details about fonts and colors. No code or libraries were
provided.

The project pulls together all the pieces learned up to this
point, including HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.
